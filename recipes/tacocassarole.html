    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This taco casserole with ground beef and tortilla chips is easy to make and very tasty. I often substitute with ground turkey and low-fat dairy products, and it's still delicious! Serve this casserole with chips, salsa, and green salad.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups salsa</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can chili beans, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups tortilla chips, crushed</li>
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (2 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green onion</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh tomato</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in salsa, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir in beans; cook until heated through.</li>
        <li>Spread crushed tortilla chips over the bottom of the baking dish; spoon beef mixture on top. Spread sour cream over beef, then sprinkle olives, green onion, and tomatoes on top. Cover with Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
